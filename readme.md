# Trubbish Installation

### The C++ behind an arduino powered interactive installation

##### Things you might want to steal:

* Servo.h - A an object wrapper for the Adafruit_PWMServoDriver class, isolated easy control of multiple servos
* Smoother.h - A simple data smoothing class with generic typing and buffer size. Doesn't use any c++ standard class functionality, so its Arduino ready out of the box.
